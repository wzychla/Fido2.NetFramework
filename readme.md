# Fido2.NetFramework

The goal of this project is to port the [fido2-net-lib](https://github.com/passwordless-lib/fido2-net-lib) to .NET Framework 4.8.
The **fido2-net-lib** targets .NET6 which makes it unusable in .NET Framework 4.8 and still, there are multiple systems targeting
.NET 4.X that would benefit from employing the Fido2 protocol.
